# Study Case Application Test

This project has been developed to increase my skills on frontend and backend development.
As a Mobile Developer, sometimes we need to "think out of the box". The intention was 
create a web e-commerce like Amazon. Of course I know that an e-commerce takes a lot
more of effort and core/visual features, but I'm trying to do my best.

## Install project

In the project directory, you can run

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Done Features
In this app you'll be able to create your account, post your products, access your products, and delete them. You're not able to make any kind of changes on other user's "products".
